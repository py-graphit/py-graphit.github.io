    "The abbility to always interact with the same consistent API regardless of the graph state is an attractive benefit of the library. But graphit goes one step further by dynamically building the Graph objects and allowing the user to add or change the objects methods through the use of an Object Relation Mapper (ORM).\n",

    "This design strategy provides a powerfull means to have fine grained control over the graph behaviour and the functionality of the returned Graph object. This turns an already feature rich graph library into a dynamic data modelling library, a combination unique to graphit."
